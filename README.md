### üê≥ With Docker

There is an example compose file [here](./Docker/docker-compose.yml). Be sure to generate a secret key and adjust the admin username and password.

### üéß Plex Integration (Optional)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand Plex integration details</summary>

The app includes optional integration with [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), allowing you to link directly to audiobooks in your Plex library. This integration adds "View on Plex" links to books that exist in your Plex library.

#### Setup

1. **Environment Variables**: Add the following environment variables to enable Plex integration:
  
  ```
    PLEX_URL=https://your-plex-server.com
    PLEX_TOKEN=your-plex-token
    PLEX_LIBRARY_NAME=Audiobooks
  ```

2. **Plex Token**: To find your Plex token, please refer to the [official documentation](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/).

3. **Library Name**: Use the exact name of your audiobooks library in Plex (case-sensitive).

4. **How It Works**: When a book detail page is viewed, the app will automatically search your Plex library for matching books by title and author, and add a "View on Plex" link if found.

5. **No Configuration Needed**: There's no additional setup required beyond setting the environment variables - the integration is designed to work seamlessly in the background.

#### Troubleshooting

- The search uses the author and book title to find matches, so ensure your Plex library has accurate metadata
- The search removes subtitles (text after colons) from book titles for better matching
- For best results, maintain consistent naming conventions between your Hardcover and Plex libraries

### üìö Kavita Integration (Optional)

<details>

#### Setup

1. **Environment Variables**: Add the following environment variables to enable Kavita integration:

  ```
    KAVITA_BASE_URL=https://your-kavita-server.com
    KAVITA_API_KEY=your-kavita-api-key
  ```

2. **API Key**: You can find or create your Kavita API key in the Kavita interface under Settings > Account -> API Key / OPDS.

3. **How It Works**: When a book detail page is viewed, the app will automatically search your Kavita library for matching books and add a "View on Kavita" link if found.

4. **No Configuration Needed**: There's no additional setup required beyond setting the environment variables - the integration is designed to work seamlessly in the background.

#### Troubleshooting

- The search uses the book title to find matches, so ensure your Kavita library has accurate metadata
- The search removes subtitles (text after colons) from book titles for better matching
- For best results, maintain consistent naming conventions between your Hardcover and Kavita libraries

<details>
<summary>Click to expand Dollar Bets functionality details</summary>

### Setup

**Environment Variable**: Add the following environment variable to enable the dollar bets feature:

```
DOLLAR_BETS_ENABLED=True
```

**Per-Group Activation**: Even with the feature enabled at the instance level, group admins must explicitly enable dollar bets for their specific book clubs in group settings.

**Key Features**:

- Reader Predictions: Members can create specific bets about plot developments, character fates, and other story elements.
- Spoiler Protection: Three-tier spoiler system (No Spoilers, Halfway Through, Finished Book) prevents unwanted plot revelations.
- Simple Management: Users can accept open bets or cancel their own proposals.
- Admin Tools: Group admins can create bets between specific members and resolve outcomes.

**How It Works**:
- Members propose predictions with a $1 stake
- Other members can accept bets they disagree with
- Admins resolve bets by declaring winners when outcomes are known
- All bets are organized by status (Open, Active, Resolved, Inconclusive) for easy tracking
